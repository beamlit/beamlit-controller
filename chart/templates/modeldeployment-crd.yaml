                                    selector is the string-encoded form of a standard kubernetes label selector for the given metric
                                    When set, it is passed as an additional parameter to the metrics server for more specific metrics scoping.
                                    When unset, just the metricName will be used to gather metrics.

                          For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                          "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                          the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                          index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                          referencing a part of an object.
